# SAMA Energia Website — Repo Rules

This is a **static site**: plain HTML/CSS, no frameworks. Pages are generated
by a dependency-free local script (decided 2026-08-20 for real URLs + per-page
SEO metadata) — **no server-side build**; generated output is committed.

- Sources: `src/fi.html` and `src/et.html` (one file per language). Edit these,
  never the generated pages (`index.html`, `<slug>/index.html`, `et/**`,
  `sitemap.xml`, `_headers`).
- Build: `node scripts/build-pages.mjs` · Verify: `node scripts/verify-pages.mjs`
- Run both after every content change and commit sources + output together.

The generated pages on `main` are the live public site.

## Language

All customer-facing text is Finnish or Estonian and requires a
**native-speaker pass** before merging to `main`.

## Content rules that bind this repo

- No partner names.
- No individual bios.
- No track-record claims.
- No figures without a documented source.

When in doubt, leave it out and flag it.
